Introducing the latest update of passbolt Pro, release v4. This update includes some significant enhancements to the platform’s functionality and overall user experience. 

Among the new features is the Google SSO integration, making it easier for users to access their accounts. In addition, we’ve implemented a new LDAP library that empower admins with more control over directory synchronisation. Refined LDAP search requests allow admins to sync more information and manage data easier. These new features give admins the ability to sync group names, users first names, and users last names.

The overall accessibility of the platform has improved as well, making it easier for all users to navigate and use. Manifest V3 maintenance updates have been implemented to optimise the browser extensions performance, stability, and compatibility. With this update PHP 7.4 is the minimum requirement, please make the needed adjustments to prevent any interruption of service. Finally, this release includes numerous bug fixes and security improvements, addressing various issues reported by our users.

Thank you for your continued support, and we hope you enjoy the enhanced features and improvements in this release. Please don't hesitate to reach out to our support team if you have any questions or feedback.
