Introducing the latest update of passbolt Pro, release v4. This update includes some significant enhancements to the platformâ€™s functionality and overall user experience. 

{% include messages/warning.html
    content="**Attention:** This is a major change, so make sure you check the platform requirements, and do a test upgrade, before you update your live systems to the new version!"
%}
 

Passbolt now requires a minimum of PHP 7.4 to run, but also supports PHP 8.2, which means faster performance and security. The browser extension is also getting a bit of love with some much needed maintenance to Manifest v3 and it requires at least a Passbolt API v3 to run.

**Please also note the LDAP file configuration format has changed due to a LDAP library migration. The LDAP plugin will be automatically disabled on the Passbolt upgrade to the new version.** This is to prevent any users/groups synchronisation to be executed (either manually or by a cron job) until the administrator has checked the migration guide and that their LDAP settings have been updated (and ideally tested using dry-run).

While this is a breaking change, the LDAP updates provide greater flexibility and customisation. This version of the  LDAP plugin gives you control over user directory synchronisation with refined search requests and the ability to synchronise more data (group names, user first and last names). Refined LDAP search requests allow admins to sync more information and manage data easier. These new features give admins the ability to sync group names, users first names, and users last names.
