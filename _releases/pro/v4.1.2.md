Version 4.1.2 of passbolt is a maintenance release mainly solving small bugs reported by the community on the API as well as the browser extension.
The API ships with a fix that restores email notifications for organisations using NTLM to authenticate against their SMTP server.
On the client side, the browser extension ships with a long time due [improvement](https://github.com/passbolt/passbolt_browser_extension/issues/188) that will help users to distinguish look alike characters while previewing a password. Furthermore and in a continuous effort to provide the best user experience, the extension ships with fixes about the auto-fill capabilities. It should be more resilient and integrate better with web applications.

Thank you for helping us make Passbolt better!
