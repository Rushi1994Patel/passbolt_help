Announcing the release of passbolt v4, packed with several notable additions and improvements. Administrators can now create user recovery links directly from the command line, making it easier to help users regain access.

This release also focuses on accessibility improvements to ensure an inclusive experience for all users across all versions. In addition, the minimum PHP requirement is now PHP 7.4, so be sure to update to avoid any interruption in service. Manifest V3 maintenance updates have been implemented to optimise the browser extensions performance, stability, and compatibility. 

Alongside these feature updates, v4 includes numerous bug fixes and security enhancements to further improve system reliability. Itâ€™s recommended that all users update to this latest version to get the most out of passbolt. 

We appreciate the continued support and feedback as we strive to provide an exceptional user experience.
