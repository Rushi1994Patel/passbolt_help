## Summary
Leak of confidential information detected during UAT phase of the Android app 1.13.1.

*   **CVE:** N/A
*   **Product affected:** API (Pro and CE) and the Android app
*   **Version affected:** 
    *   API version under v3.12.2
    *   Android app under 1.13.2
*   **Version fixed:** 
    *   API v3.12.2
    *   Android app 1.13.2
*   **Affected component:** Resources creation form.
*   **Vulnerability Type:** Information leak
*   **Severity:** N/A

## Problem
The issue has been present since the first version of the passbolt mobile app released to the Google Play Store. When creating a resource from the Android app an unencrypted version of the description was sent to the API along with its encrypted version contained in the secret. However the default content type (password-and-description) should not contain the unencrypted version of the description.

%}


On top of that as the API doesnâ€™t not ignore the sent unencrypted description, it stores it in cleartext along the resources metadata in the database.

## Who's impacted
Organizations who have users who created resources that have a non-empty description  from their Android app or directly via the API if this one was misused. Note that only the resources created are impacted, and that the issue is not occurring on the edition process.

## Fix
- MOB-1250 Fix the Android app by not sending the description field to the backend during resource creation
- PB-24315 Add validation of received resource fields on the backend according to the schema
- PB-24315 Run a script to clear the description field in all resources of type encrypted password with encrypted description

## Event Timeline

- 20/04/2023 - Bug identified
- 26/04/2023 - Android app fixed with 1.13.2
- 26/04/2023 - API fixed with v3.12.2
